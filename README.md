# Attacking_a_computer_using_the_esp8266_component



## Task subject:

Attacking a computer using the esp8266 component.

## Introduction:

In this project,
an ESP8266 device is programmed using Arduino software (which burns into a closed source component) to create fake networks with common names.

## Motivation:

Phones and laptops constantly send Wi-Fi radio signals to connect to a wireless network,
to protect user privacy Phone makers use random MAC addresses to make phones and their users more difficult to track by MAC address randomization.
When a phone connects to a network that it trusts it reveals to it its true MAC address and this is a weakness that we will want to exploit in 
our project so that we can achieve the goals we have set for ourselves.
Of course there are a lot of advantages in attacking a "person in the middle" since we can control communication between devices,
achieve the location of the devices, etc.

## Dishes:

- ESP8266 component and micro-USB cable.
- Arduino software for writing code on the component.
- Wireshark software for controlling the data.
